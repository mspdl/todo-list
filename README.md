# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# üîê Environment Variables Setup

This project uses **Firebase** for data storage and authentication.  
To keep sensitive credentials secure, all Firebase configuration values must be stored in a local environment file that is **not committed** to the repository.

Follow the steps below to set it up:

---

## 1. Create a `.env.local` file

In the **root directory** of your project (the same level as `package.json`)

## 2. Add your Firebase credentials

Copy your Firebase configuration values from the Firebase Console and define them as environment variables in the `.env.local` file.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è All variables **must start with `REACT_APP_`** so that Create React App can access them during build time.

```env
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain_here
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket_here
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id_here
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id_here
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
